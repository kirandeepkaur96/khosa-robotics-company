  # For our venture we take a differentiation strategies.


  **My venture is making robot for house maintenance. These robot have all the
  feature as human being. We did not target any specific segment. This will be
  helpful for human to make relationship with them. old people can enjoy their
  company when they are alone at home. Children can play games with them. Also
  this project will be costly because robot have so many costly parts.**
