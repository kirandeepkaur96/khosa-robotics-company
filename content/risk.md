subtitle: "**Machines can do many difficulty and accurate task as compared to human beings. Also,**\r\n\n**machines don’t get sick, tired and they don’t get injured. Machines can work in few seconds**\r\n\n**which human can take hours to complete it. However, machines also create some hazards for**\r\n\n**human and workplace. Here, I want to describe some risks for my venture**.\n\n**1. TECHNOLOGY RISK: This is major risk for my venture because my venture is based**\r\n\n**on technology. There are many technology risks like power failure, control error, and**\r\n\n**improper installation.Robot installation should be correctly all parts of robot install well**\r\n\n**otherwise it create problem for working. Without proper maintenance a robot could easily**\r\n\n**break down when it is performing activities. It is based on electricity so electricity signal**\r\n\n**can create problem for power supply lines.**\n\n**2. MARKET RISK: Market risk involves the risk of changing conditions in the**\r\n\n**marketplace which a company competes for business. As I am late followers then there**\r\n\n**might be market risk for my venture because there are so many other companies whose**\r\n\n**already introduce robots in many fields. So before making any venture research the needs**\r\n\n**of customer, whether you can build them effectively, in a timely fashion and make it**\r\n\n**better and different as compared to other companies.**\n\n**3. FINANCIAL RISK: To Startup for any new venture financial risk is biggest risk because**\r\n\n**there is no guarantee for any business whether it is successful or not. As my venture**\r\n\n**needed too much money for investing because robots have many costly parts and, also it**\r\n\n**is based on technology. It is an important for doing any new venture to determine if their**\r\n\n**service is strong to support the financial funds of your venture. Lack of funds also create** \r\n\n**problem for starting any new venture.**"
